			<h2>Commentary</h2>
			<p>I have read <i>The Well of Loneliness</i> with great interest because⁠—apart from its fine qualities as a novel by a writer of accomplished art⁠—it possesses a notable psychological and sociological significance. So far as I know, it is the first English novel which presents, in a completely faithful and uncompromising form, one particular aspect of sexual life as it exists among us to-day. The relation of certain people⁠—who while different from their fellow human beings, are sometimes of the highest character and the finest aptitudes⁠—to the often hostile society in which they move, presents difficult and still unsolved problems. The poignant situations which thus arise are here set forth so vividly, and yet with such complete absence of offence, that we must place Radclyffe Hall’s book on a high level of distinction.</p>
